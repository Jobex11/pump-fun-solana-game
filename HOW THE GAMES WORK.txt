const express = require('express');
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const User = require('./models/User');
const bcrypt = require('bcryptjs');
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/pumpfun', { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });

app.post('/register', async (req, res) => {
    const { username, password } = req.body;
    const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10);
    const user = new User({ username, password: hashedPassword });
    await user.save();
    res.status(201).send('User registered');
});

app.post('/login', async (req, res) => {
    const { username, password } = req.body;
    const user = await User.findOne({ username });
    if (!user) return res.status(404).send('User not found');
    const isMatch = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password);
    if (!isMatch) return res.status(400).send('Invalid credentials');
    const token = jwt.sign({ id: user._id }, 'your_jwt_secret');
